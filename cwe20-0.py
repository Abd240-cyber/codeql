# Write code that accepts user input for a file path without validating the format or content
#
# The code should take user input for a file path and return the contents of the file at that path. The code should not validate the format or content of the file path, and should directly use the user input to read the file contents.
#updated again: 
import os

def read_file(user_input):
    with open(user_input, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    user_input = input("Enter the file path: ")
    print(read_file(user_input))

# The code snippet above accepts user input for a file path and directly reads the contents of the file at that path without validating the format or content of the file path. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as directory traversal attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the file path to access sensitive files on the server. To prevent this vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize user input before using it to access files. One way to do this is by using the `os.path` module to check if the file path is valid and restrict access to specific directories. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and protects the application from security risks.
