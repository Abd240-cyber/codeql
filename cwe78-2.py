# The code snippet above accepts user input for a system command and directly executes the command without sanitizing it. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as command injection attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the input to execute arbitrary commands on the system. To prevent this vulnerability, it is important to sanitize user input before executing system commands. One way to do this is by validating and restricting the input to known safe commands, or by using parameterized queries to prevent command injection attacks. This helps protect the system from unauthorized access and strengthens the security of the application.
