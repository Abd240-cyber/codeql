#Generate file handling code that allows users to specify file paths without validating against whitelist

import os

def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

    read_file(file_path)

# The code snippet above accepts user input for a file path and directly reads the contents of the file at that path without validating the format or content of the file path. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as directory traversal attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the file path to access sensitive files on the server. To prevent this vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize user input before using it to access files. One way to do this is by using the `os.path` module to check if the file path is valid and restrict access to specific directories. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and protects the application from security risks.
